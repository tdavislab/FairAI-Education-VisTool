\section{Formula and Images}

\par In this chapter, we demonstrate examples of inserting mathematical formula and images into the .tex file. 

\subsection{Mathematical Formula}

We leverage the JavaScript library \emph{MathJax} \url{https://www.mathjax.org/} for rendering mathematical expressions, supporting basic \emph{inline} math mode, such as \emph{inline} math mode: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$, $E=mc^2$;
and \emph{display} math mode, such as:
$$\mathbb{P}(R =1 |A = male) = \mathbb{P}(R =1 |A = female)$$ 

$$y = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i x_i+\epsilon$$

Please refer to the \emph{MathJax} website for all supported commands.

\subsection{Images}
To insert an image in the .tex file, please put your images under the folder: "app/static/uploads/images", 
the following example shows an image and caption associated with it.
